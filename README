Collection of Emacs packages I either "officially" maintain (desktop-menu), or
found elsewhere in an unsatisfactory state and felt interested enough to try
to make them better.

Branches:
=========
master -- contains what I really consider better (or just (usefully)
different, as is the case with `cal-china-x') and shareable versions (apart
from those "Inital commit/import", in which case I usually have (sometimes
considerable) changes in my work tree, but it's still too much work in
progress -- basically those should be in priv, but are not, because there was
no priv yet when I have already published master), and can be expected not to
be rebased.

priv -- WIP, just in case someone was interested; anything can happen there...
(but still not *everything* -- I have the bad habit (I hope I'll get rid of in
the end) of occasionally accumulating a lot in work tree and only then
splitting it up into commits... a year or two later :-))

As always, comments welcome.

Library summaries:
==================
cal-china-x.el --- Chinese calendar extras
desktop-menu.el --- menu for managing Emacs desktops
ell.el* --- Browse the Emacs Lisp List
file-journal.el --- revisit files by date or visit count
file-props.el* --- Add file properties to your files
globalff.el --- Global find file
yaoddmuse.el --- yet another Oddmuse mode for Emacs

(Those marked with an asterisk are there, but have no changes, I haven't
touched them for ages and don't know if I ever will at this point.)
